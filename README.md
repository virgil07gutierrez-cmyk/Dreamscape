CALLING ALL CODERS: Build the AI Platform for Mapping SHARED DREAMS

The Role:
Seeking a highly driven Founding Full-Stack Developer interested in AI and data. You will own the front-end, backend, and the integration pipeline (AI + visual matching logic).
Skills we need (Pick 2+):
• React/Vue
• Python (Django/Flask) / Node.js
• DB setup (Postgres/Mongo)
Why Join?
• Resume Gold: Unique, interdisciplinary project showcasing AI integration.
• Academic Credit: We can structure this for a Capstone or Independent Study.
• Impact: Contribute to a real psychological study on consciousness.
• Team: It's about "Us and Ours"—total collaboration and shared success.
"Is that recurring place in your dream real? Do other people see it too?. Let’s use code to find out."
This is a great project that has high potential for income in the future.
